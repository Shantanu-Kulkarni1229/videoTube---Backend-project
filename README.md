## Features

- **User Management**: User registration, login, and authentication using JWT.
- **Video Management**: Upload, update, delete, and fetch video data.
- **Comment System**: Add, delete, and fetch comments on videos.
- **Search Functionality**: Search videos by title or description.
- **Testing**: Endpoints thoroughly tested using Postman.

## Technologies Used

### Backend
- **Node.js**: Runtime environment for building server-side applications.
- **Express.js**: Web framework for handling routing and middleware.

### Database
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for storing user and video data.
- **Mongoose**: ODM library for MongoDB, enabling schema-based modeling.

### API Testing
- **Postman**: Used for testing and validating API endpoints.

### Additional Libraries
- **dotenv**: For environment variable management.
- **jsonwebtoken**: For implementing secure JWT-based authentication.
- **multer**: For handling file uploads (e.g., videos and thumbnails).
- **bcryptjs**: For password hashing.
- **mongoose-pagination-v2**: For implementing pagination in database queries.
